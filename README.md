# Next.js Shadcn Starter

This is a starter template for building Next.js applications with Shadcn/ui.

## Getting Started

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `bun build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
